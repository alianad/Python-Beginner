# 🐍 Python-Beginner Projects
Welcome to my **Python Beginner Portfolio**! This repository showcases my journey in Python, covering fundamental concepts, problem-solving approaches, and small projects that highlight my growth as a programmer.


## 🚀 About This Repository
This repository is a collection of Python scripts and exercises that reflect my progress as I learn the core aspects of Python. 
It includes topics ranging from basic syntax to functions, data structures, and debugging.


## 📂 What I’ve Learned

This repository covers the beginner aspects of Python, including:

- **Variables & Data Types** – Declaring variables, type conversion, and handling type errors.
- **Mathematical Operations** – Performing arithmetic and understanding operator precedence.
- **Control Flow** – `if-else` statements, nested `if`, multiple `if`, and logical operators.
- **Random Module & Lists** – Using the `random` module and working with lists.
- **Loops** – `for` loops and iteration techniques.
- **Functions** – Writing functions with inputs, using positional & keyword arguments.
- **Dictionaries & Nested Data Structures** – Working with dictionaries, nested lists, and dictionaries.
- **Functions with Outputs** – Returning single and multiple values from functions.
- **Scope & Namespace** – Understanding local scope, block scope, global variables, and global constants.
- **Debugging** – Identifying and fixing common errors in Python.


## 🖥️ How to Use
To compile and include `libft` in your projects:
